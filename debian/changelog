darkradiant (1.3.2svn5614~lucid1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Extended PopupMenu interface and functionality a bit, with the goal to let the
  OrthoContext menu derive from gtkutil::PopupMenu.

  * Add RENDER_DEPTHWRITE to blend materials, this should really fix issue #2230
  now.

  * If pure "map" stages without blend type are encountered, this is still taken
  as editor preview pass, it's better than "shader not found".

  * Fixed default diffusemap shader pass not writing to depth buffer, looked wrong
  in lighting mode.

  * Fixed decals rendered invisible in lighting mode.     
  
  * Fixed default map stages not writing to the depth buffer.

  * Fixed a copy&paste error in Vector3::isValid(). Thanks to razor85 for spotting
  it.

  * Don't use bumpmaps as editor image.

  * Made "Convert to func_static" a proper event/command, so that it's accessible
  via the console.

  * Fixed issue #2248: Ortho views always aligned to Z_Y on startup (splitpane
  layout).

  * Fixed issue #2253: Curve control points need to be interpreted as world
  coordinates at all times. Removed code from previous fix attempts.

  * Fixed issue #2274: If a patch shader is filtered, the patch itself can still
  be selected/affected.

darkradiant (1.3.1svn5594~lucid1) lucid; urgency=low

  * OpenGLShaderPasses are checked if they are applicable before calling
  their render() method. Calling render() usually invokes a series of openGL
  state change calls, even if the whole pass has zero renderables attached.

  * Fixed issue #2230: Portal Sky texture rendering black in rendered
  view. Blend mode conversion from string was failing due to wrong case of
  default values.

  * Fixed issue #2221: Thicken algorithm has problems with patch cones.

  * Removed additional isVisible() checks from PatchNode render methods, these
  nodes are culled by the ForeachVisibleNodeInVolume routine in the scenegraph
  before. This fixes issue #2204: noninstantiated patchnodes are invisible in
  the map preview window.

  * Removed "o" and "c" key mappings to OK and Cancel buttons in gtkutil::Dialog.
  This solves issue #2232.

  * Fixed issue #2216: Cloned projected light does not show projection until map
  reloaded.

  * Some reorganisation in mapdoom3 format to allow for more distinct behaviour
  when loading maps and prefabs. 

  * Resolved issue #2207: Reversed or customizable splitpane.

  * Updated German translation package.

  * Enabled dm.editing plugin in Linux
