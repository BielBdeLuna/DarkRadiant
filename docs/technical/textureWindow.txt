TEXTURE WINDOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The QER-style texture window is in texwindow.cpp.

The display of individual textures is handled by Texture_Draw() in this file.
Updates to affect the display of textures (such as normalisation of size) would
be done in this function.
