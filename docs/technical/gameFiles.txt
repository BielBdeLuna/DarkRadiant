GAME FILES (*.game)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game files are XML and contain important information to customise Radiant for
the specified game.

As of 20060402 the settings used by GtkRadiant are all attributes of the <game>
declaration. There are no apparent ill effects caused by inserting additional
nodes within the <game> declaration, suggesting this file may be extended to 
hold additional information.

The scanning for game files is run in preferences.cpp with CGameDialog::Init().
The CGameDialog class holds a list of game files and throws and error at 
startup if it is not able to populate it (either due to a lack of files or due
to a failure to parse the XML).
