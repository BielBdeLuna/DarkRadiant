PROCESSING OF LIGHT ENTITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The light creation code is split between entity.* in the radiant dir and the
entity.h and light.cpp code in the entity plugin. This is due to limitations
on the plugin API.

The setting of keyvals happens in the eclass_doom3 code. This is not linked to
the actual drawn radius until the keyvals are changed through the entity 
inspector, so it is possible for a light to be spawned with a drawn radius that 
differs from the keyval setting.

As of 20060402 the light entity is identified by a simple string comparison of
the entity name and "light". Future plans are to remove this hardcoding and
replace it with external configuration in an XML file (perhaps the game file).
The comparison takes place in eclass_doom3.cpp, which is also responsible for
resolving inheritance.
