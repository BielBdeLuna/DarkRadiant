DarkRadiant
===========

DarkRadiant is a level (map) editor for the The Dark Mod, an open-source Doom 3
modification which is available at http://forums.thedarkmod.com/

Compiling on Windows
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

DarkRadiant is built on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. The free
Express version can be obtained here:

http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

Since DarkRadiant uses a lot of open-source libraries that are not available on
Windows by default, you will also need to download and install the
dependencies. 7-Zip packages of the dependencies are available at the following
URL(s):

32-bit only builds:
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w32deps.7z

64-bit builds:
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w32deps.7z
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w64deps.7z

Note that 64-bit builds need the 32-bit dependencies in addition to their own
64-bit dependencies.

The dependencies directories need to be downloaded or copied into the main
DarkRadiant source directory, i.e. alongside the include/ and radiant/
directories, and using their correct names.

Build
-----

The main Visual C++ solution file is:

tools/msvc2010/DarkRadiant.sln

Open this file with Visual C++ 2010 and start a build by right-clicking on the
top-level "Solution 'DarkRadiant'" item and choosing Build Solution.
